description: Build the kidbox instruction booklet from LaTeX source
---

Build the kidbox documentation:

1. Navigate to the doc/ directory
2. Run `make` to compile the LaTeX documentation
3. Verify that kidbook.pdf and kidbook-booklet.pdf are generated
4. Report any LaTeX compilation errors

Note: This requires texlive to be installed. The README recommends building on a development machine rather than on the Raspberry Pi.
